### Additional Information
Outside of the Certificate Program, I enjoy running & yoga! I am also an avid sports fan - Go Panthers (And Georgia Bulldogs)!  

Currently, I work full-time for an Investment Bank as a Business Manager supporting our technologists. I focus on Financial Management strategies; identifying different spending patterns and trends across our organization.  

I am looking forward to this class and learning more about R, Data Science and the potential applications of both to my personal, as well as professional, interests!
