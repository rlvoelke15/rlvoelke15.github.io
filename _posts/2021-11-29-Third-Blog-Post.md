## Prompt

PROMPT:
Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R. What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do? What are your current thoughts in terms of using R for data science? Do you think you’ll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not? What things are you doing to do different in practice now that you’ve had this course?

## Blog Post

In re-reading my previous Blog Posts, I think my understanding of data science, as well as R, hasn’t necessarily _changed_, but has expanded and grown over the past 3 months. 

My initial understanding of data science was quite broad and all-encompassing. I find this to still be true, but I can dig a bit deeper and understand the different roles of a data scientist. Much like the structure of this course, I find that a data scientist is someone who can (1) read & manipulate data, (2) summarize the data, (3) statistically analyze the data, and (4), communicate that data in a meaningful way to your customer.

R is a programming tool that enables a data scientist to do each of these tasks. Within R, we can read and scrape data using packages like `readr`, manipulate and summarize data with packages like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, analyze and model data with packages like `caret` and efficiently communicate our findings with tools like RShiny. 

In my earlier blog posts, I wrote about my preference to SAS over R. I also wrote about my identification with the role of a ‘statistician’ as compared to a ‘data scientist’. After this course, I think I see more of the similarities between these two roles, but would also say that I can confidently identify as a data scientist. I have built the foundation to be able to successfully navigate through the lifecycle of reading, summarizing & analyzing, and communicating key results, as it relates to a dataset(s). 

Prior to this course, I would have said I was only comfortable with data summarization and analysis. I think the area where I have learned the most is the ‘communication’ component of the lifecycle and being able to utilize tools like RShiny or HTML output to tell a story with my data. I will continue to use R for the purposes of building interactive dashboards to be able to meaningfully communicate patterns and findings in my data, going forward.

Looking back on these past 3 months, I really surprised myself with my ability to be open to another programming tool, like R, when I was so comfortable and familiar with SAS. While I know there is loads more to learn about and explore within R, I think this course really helped to introduce me to the tool (R Studio) and the R language and build my foundational knowledge to continue expanding on in the future.
