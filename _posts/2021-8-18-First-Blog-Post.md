**Prompt**: What do you think being a data scientist is about? What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? What differences / similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

In reading through the various articles on Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and their likeness, I have arrived at the (somewhat unsurprising) conclusion that the term ‘data science’ is a broad one. It can constitute a multitude of roles & responsibilities, although I’ve identified some key duties & knowledge areas that appear as a common thread, regardless of whom you ask.

A data scientist is an individual who can extract the ‘best of both worlds’ (or actually, three ‘worlds’). These ‘worlds’ are those of statistics, programming, and specific business knowledge. A data scientist would use the data science process (ingestion, transformation, analysis, etc.) to both answer and ask questions as it relates to a specific business objective or goal. 

When I ask myself how this differs from a statistician, I realize in large part, it doesn’t differ at all. A statistician has the same goal of extracting and inferring knowledge from a dataset to arrive at a conclusion. 

While the overall objective of the two may be similar, the approach they take to arrive at any one conclusion might differ. For example, where a statistician may use familiar, ‘simple’ models and refine them until they meet the commonplace, statistical assumptions; a data scientist may use machine learning to predict the best model for arriving at the same outcome. 

Through these readings, I learned that machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence, whereby data algorithms enable computers to predict outcomes, with a high degree of accuracy. A machine learning engineer is well-educated in the tools required to code and deploy these algorithms, as defined by a data scientist. 

While there seems to be some general ‘hostility’ in the industry between data scientists and statisticians, I believe that one cannot exist without the other. As mentioned earlier, a statistician and a data scientist can likely arrive at the same conclusion, albeit via different methods. A data scientist may be able to take the application of these statistics a step further and evolve them in a way that is efficient (via programming) and valuable to the customer (via in-depth product knowledge). 

When I think about myself as it relates to these two roles, I tend to think of myself as a statistician. I have studied statistics and its’ application on and off for the past 6 years. During that time, I have also spent time as a Business Manager, understanding the needs and demands of my clients, which I think positions me well to begin studying the ever-ambiguous ‘data science’. Where I believe I lack the knowledge (currently) to call myself a data scientist is in the programming ‘world’. While I have significant experience with SAS, I don’t have greater exposure to more universal languages like R, Java, Python, etc. 

I look forward to being able to dip my toes into R this semester to further broaden my horizons and explore the evolving role of data scientists today!
